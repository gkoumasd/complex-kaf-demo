This is a demo of the complex-valued KAF neural network proposed in this paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08026

We train the network on the Fashion MNIST dataset, after extracting the frequency components
from every image.

## Prerequisites

The code needs the Autograd library:

Code for cloning the Fashion MNIST repository (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
is provided in the notebook.

## Execution

Simply runs the steps in the notebook to (1) load data, (2) define the models, and (3) train it.
